# Troubleshooting
Most likely, your video is not downloading because: 

1. The video is too long (1+ hours)
2. You are being rate limited (see below)
3. The video is private or region locked
4. It is a movie

## Rate Limiting
YouTube can block your IP if you send too many requests to download a video.

You can get around this using a proxy or VPN.

The best way to get around it is to wait a couple days.
